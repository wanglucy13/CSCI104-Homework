Program is a tiny version of Amazon.com in which users and products are put into a database and users and products can be searched, products can be purchased, and the resulting database is updated into a new database file. The format is a clean user interface that contains a list of products, list of corresponding reviews for the product, list of users, and different search types and sort types. The user can search for items in the search bar by pressing the search button. The user can decide to purchase the shopping cart or remove items from their cart as well as add items to the cart. The user can save the updated Amazon database by typing the new database file into the save bar and by pressing the save button. 

Tried to implement splay tree but did not work. Didn't implement into amazon but still included the file for testing purposes/partial credit.
