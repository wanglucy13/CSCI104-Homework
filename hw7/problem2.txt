Problem 2 Explanation

The player class is a public class where it contains the strength, defense, items, transportation, and experience points. All classes relating to that have a "has a" relationship. Items is a public abstract class where heal potion, magic potion, phoenix down, weapons, and armor inherit form items. This is because you can have many different items but you cannot have just an item. Similarly with weapons and armor, they are abstract because you can have multiple weapon types like sword, mace, axe, crossbow, spear etc. For armor, you can also have chainmail, sheild, helmet, and gaunlets. You cannot simply reach into your inventory and take out one armor or one weapon; you always take out a specific item or armor. There is also a variable that counts for the quantity that is private so the user cannot just grant themselves multiple items.

The transportation class is a public abstract class that has a "has a" relationship with player. The player can have a different types of transportation but not just one single "transportation". For example, the player can have a horse, airship or ship. These modes of transportation have an "is a" relationship with the transportation class because the modes of transportation are a form of transportation. 

The terrain class is also a public abstract class that contains different types of terrain which have an is a relationship with the terrain class. Terrain has a "has a" relationship with transportation because each form of terrain has a type of transportation to get around the land. For example, the water terrain has a ship to sail across the seas.
